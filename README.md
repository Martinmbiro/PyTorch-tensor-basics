Hello again 👋
+ A **[`tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)** is the fundamental data structure in [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/)
+ This repository covers tensor creation and manipulation
+ I illustrate the implementation of these concepts in the notebooks _(labeled 01...13)._ Comments, working code, and links to the latest official documentation are included every step of the way
+ As always, feel free to build upon these concepts

## Tools ⚒️
1. [`Google Colab`](https://colab.google/) - A hosted _Jupyter Notebook_ service by Google
2. [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for making static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
3. [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
4. [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) -  An open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library, that's used for building Deep Learning models

## Reference 📚
+ Thanks to the insight gained from [`Microsoft Learn`](https://learn.microsoft.com), and [`Udemy`](https://www.udemy.com/)
+ Not forgetting these gorgeous gourgeous [`emojis`](https://gist.github.com/FlyteWizard/468c0a0a6c854ed5780a32deb73d457f) 😻
